      <h2>What is <span class="span">Pomodoro Technique</span>?</h2>
      <p>
        The Pomodoro Technique is a way of managing your time in order to stay
        focused which was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It
        uses a timer to break work into intervals.

      <h2>How<span class="span"> Pomodoro Technique</span> works?</h2>
      <p>
        The idea is to set a timer for 25 minutes and to work on a task until
        the timer goes off. If you get distracted or interrupted during the 25
        minutes, start the 25 minutes of work over again. Once you’ve
        successfully focused on work for 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break. When
        your break is over, repeat the 25 minutes of work and 5 minute break.
        After you’ve completed four 25 minute blocks of work, take a longer
        15-30 minute break.
